			#Summary:
				#Over the course of the years od 2012 to 2021, developing countries - on the average:
					#Had a higher rate of adult mortality	(4.1%)
                    #Had more infants die	(6.9)
                    #Spent less on health care		($464.2)	
						#NOT REPORTED DUE TO LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN DATA AND MISREPRESENTATION
							#Had LESS cases of measles		(218.6)
					#Had lower BMIs		(11.4 points)
                    #Had more children under 5 die		(8.5)
                    #Had lower rates of vaccination for polio and diphtheria	(1.2 and 1.3 percentage points - Both Developed and Developing were > 94%)
                    #Had more HIV/AIDS related deaths	(0.3)
                    #Had a lower GDP per capita		($7,431.2)
                    #Had a higher rate of thinness in 1-19 and 5-9 year olds	(2.6 percentage points)
                    #AND
					#Had less education		(2.7 years)
				#Than those in developed countries

#Notes:
	#I would use a more trustworthy dataset in the future
		#Data was gathered from multiple sources and didn't supply a rock solid data dictionary (one had to be created using educated guesses)
		#Supports the claim that developed countries have MORE measles cases than developing
			#This could be true, however without population we can't calculate the rate - which is more comparable than sheer cases
			#There are a lot of zeros in the data - perhaps data wasn't collected properly for all countries leading to bias
